            <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="profilepicture">
            <p>My name is Casey Sprouse. I was born in Salt Lake City, Utah and grew up in Southern California
                until I was 14. I have lived in Utah since then, and currently reside in Bountiful City. I work as
                a city worker for the water department while I go to school to earn my degree through BYU-Idaho. I
                am married and have 4 children, expecting our 5th in February. I enjoy the challenge of learning
                new things and am excited to learn more about web development.
